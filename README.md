ðŸ”„ SMART RAG Agent
A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that implements a corrective multi-stage workflow using LangGraph. This system combines document retrieval, relevance grading, query transformation, and web search to provide comprehensive and accurate responses.

Features
Smart Document Retrieval: Uses Qdrant vector store for efficient document retrieval
Document Relevance Grading: Employs gpt-4o-mini to assess document relevance
Query Transformation: Improves search results by optimizing queries when needed
Web Search Fallback: Uses Tavily API for web search when local documents aren't sufficient
Multi-Model Approach: Combines OpenAI embeddings and OpenAI llm for different tasks
Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for easy document upload and querying
